This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
## Pages and navigation
    Login Page
    Order List Page
    Oder Detail Page 


##  Technological considerations
    * Login Page:
        * Email: me@tuup.fi
        * Password: ok
    * Order List Page - Order Detail Page
        * Fetching data from local fake json file 
        * The fake json file is created based on Purchasing The Order of Kyyti platform 
        * The order list page will show 2 orders (Kyyti Kimppa and Kyyti Oy)
        * The order detail page will show more details of product ( Name, Place, Price, and Maps). Maps is used for demonstration purpose. Further functionality can be enabled when using paid version of google maps. 
    * Using react-router-dom to connect 3 pages. 
    * Using google-maps-react to display google maps on order list page
    * Using Bootstrap 4 and Google Material Design for creating structure layout, navigation
    * Adding essential buttons (Sign up, Adding New Order, My Account, and Log out) to make the interface complete


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
